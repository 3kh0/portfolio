        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is 3kh0. I am 14 and a hobbyist developer, with a passion for creating intresting websites and applications. I have around 5 years of experience in programming with various languages, I have worked on a variety of projects and my skills in web design.</p>
        <p>When I'm not busy, I love to play all sorts of games on Steam, and work on little side projects. Some of these have been released, others will stay on my hard drive, never getting to see the light of day.</p>
        <p>I got started with Scratch Jr. when I was just a wee one, and then moved on with the original Scratch. I was there before all the cringe community features were added, so I feel like I witnessed its birth. After that, I got into coding for the web and had a blast playing around with javascript through bookmarklets. Then, I dove deeper into HTML and CSS and before I knew it, I was starting my own website! And now, I just have a blast creating all sorts of fun stuff on the web! If you want to see how my website looked like years ago, go to the Internet Archive and put in my github URL: "3kh0.github.io"</p>
        <p>I advocate for digital privacy and free speech, and I am a strong supporter of the open source community. I do not support DRM and any forms of censorship online. Yes, I pirate my stuff, sue me.</p>
